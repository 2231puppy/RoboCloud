# RoboCloud

## What is this?

2231puppy's Project Stida RoboCloud is an ESP32-S2 robot controller board. It has Wi-Fi courtesy of the ESP32-S2 and can drive 2 4.5A (max) motors. It has a bunch of exposed IO and can handle up to 20V in. It is designed for use with Adafruit's CircuitPython.

## What's Project Stida?

Stida was 2231puppy's first-ever robot. While no longer in use, the name lives on in Project Stida, 2231puppy's organization.

## Why would I want it?

Well, that's simple. It's a relatively low-cost board that can be used to easily build robots that are IoT-connected. Did I mention it's super easy to program because of the awesome work at [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com) on CircuitPython?

## Great! So, where can I get one?

This is the sad part :( There is currently nowhere to purcase this board, but the source KiCad v5.1.9 files are right here in this repo. Feel free to make them yourself! I'm working on an accurate BOM.
